- [ ] Add a new person to the list
- [ ] Edit a person's information on the list
- [ ] View a list of the person's interests in each person's info, which can also be edited
- [ ] Remove a person from the list
- [ ] Improve the UI to make it look prettier
- [ ] Configure the API to handle this on the mock db (see https://github.com/HavenInc/hygieia/blob/master/routes/api.js)
- [ ] **Add a new feature of your choosing!**

### Bonus ###

- [ ] Set up mongoose (http://mongoosejs.com/docs/) to store data in mongoDB
- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Show off any CSS/design skills

* Your code is readable, DRY, well-organized, and reflects a thorough understanding of Javascript
* Your code contains comments where necessary
* Your design displays familiarity with CSS beyond Bootstrap
